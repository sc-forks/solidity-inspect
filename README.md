# **WIP: UNDER CONSTRUCTION** 

This project is beginning as a clone of [jsinspect](https://github.com/danielstjules/jsinspect). 
Its goal is to become a utility that uses AST analysis to:

+ scan Solidity files for content that structurally resembles code with known vulnerabilities 
+ identify redundancies across contract systems.
